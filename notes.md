 1) npm init -y (creates package.json (npm > yarn for package.json))

 2) npm i express (installs express and other node modules)

 3) npx gitignore node (makes it so you dont have to upload ALL the node modules to github)

 6) npm run dev (this should return an "app crashed" error)

 7) rename main to main.js

 8) create main.js file

 9) add a console.log to main.js file
